# Sweet Shop Management System

This is a Sweet Shop Management System built using Django with Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
It allows users to add, view, delete, search, and manage sweet inventory such as quantity, price, and category.
Users can also purchase and restock sweets, with proper stock validations.
The project includes clean code, unit tests with pytest, and a simple web interface for interaction.
It follows best practices in Django and is version-controlled using Git.
Ideal for learning Django, TDD, and inventory system concepts.
